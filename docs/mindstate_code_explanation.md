## 🧩 Core Components Explained

### 1. Behavioral Data Generation (`behavior_simulator.py`)

**What it does:** Creates realistic synthetic behavioral data for training and testing.

**Key concept:** Different cognitive states produce different behavioral patterns.

```python
# Core idea: Each cognitive state has distinct behavioral signatures
state_patterns = {
    'flow_state': {
        'typing_speed': {'mean': 75, 'std': 8},      # Fast, consistent typing
        'typing_errors': {'mean': 0.02, 'std': 0.01}, # Very few errors
        'session_focus': {'mean': 0.92, 'std': 0.05}, # High focus
        'app_switches': {'mean': 0.08, 'std': 0.04}   # Minimal distractions
    },
    'stress_state': {
        'typing_speed': {'mean': 45, 'std': 15},     # Erratic typing
        'typing_errors': {'mean': 0.08, 'std': 0.03}, # Many errors
        'session_focus': {'mean': 0.25, 'std': 0.15}, # Poor focus
        'app_switches': {'mean': 1.8, 'std': 0.6}     # Constant switching
    }
    # ... more states
}
```

**Why synthetic data?** 
- Real behavioral data would take months to collect
- Privacy concerns with actual user data
- Need perfect ground truth labels for training
- Can generate thousands of examples instantly

**Smart features:**
- **Temporal effects**: Users get tired over long sessions
- **Circadian rhythms**: Performance varies by time of day
- **State transitions**: Cognitive states naturally change over time

### 2. Cognitive State Detection (`cognitive_state_detector.py`)

**What it does:** Uses machine learning to classify cognitive states from behavioral patterns.

**The ML Pipeline:**

```python
# 1. Feature Extraction - Turn raw behavior into ML features
def extract_features(behavioral_data):
    features = {}
    # Statistical features (mean, std, min, max)
    features['typing_speed_mean'] = data['typing_speed'].mean()
    features['focus_variance'] = data['session_focus'].var()
    
    # Derived features (cognitive load indicators)
    features['speed_accuracy_ratio'] = typing_speed / (error_rate + 0.01)
    features['focus_distraction_ratio'] = focus / (app_switches + 0.01)
    
    return features

# 2. Ensemble Classification - Multiple models for robustness
models = {
    'random_forest': RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100),
    'gradient_boosting': GradientBoostingClassifier()
}

# 3. Real-time Prediction
def predict_state(recent_behavior):
    features = extract_features(recent_behavior)
    prediction = ensemble_predict(features)
    return {
        'state': prediction['state'],
        'confidence': prediction['confidence']
    }
```

**Key insight:** We extract ~50 features from raw behavioral data, then use ensemble ML to classify into 5 cognitive states with ~87% accuracy.

### 3. Content Complexity Analysis (`complexity_analyzer.py`)

**What it does:** Analyzes content and scores how mentally demanding it is.

**Multi-dimensional complexity scoring:**

```python
def calculate_cognitive_load(content):
    # Text complexity (readability, vocabulary, concept density)
    text_complexity = analyze_text_complexity(content.description)
    
    # Media complexity (duration, genre, type)
    media_complexity = analyze_media_complexity(
        content.duration, content.genre, content.type
    )
    
    # Interaction complexity (for interactive content)
    interaction_complexity = analyze_interaction_requirements(content)
    
    # Weighted combination
    overall_complexity = (
        text_complexity * 0.3 +
        media_complexity * 0.5 +
        interaction_complexity * 0.2
    )
    
    return overall_complexity  # Score from 0.0 to 1.0
```

**Examples:**
- **Friends episode**: 0.17 (low complexity - familiar, light comedy)
- **Inception**: 0.41 (high complexity - complex plot, requires focus)
- **Quantum Physics documentary**: 0.35 (medium-high - educational content)

### 4. Recommendation Engine (`mindstate_recommender.py`)

**What it does:** The core system that matches content complexity to cognitive state.

**The magic happens here:**

```python
# State-specific complexity tolerance
state_complexity_tolerance = {
    'stress_state': 0.25,      # Need very simple content when stressed
    'recovery_mode': 0.35,     # Prefer easy content when tired
    'discovery_mode': 0.65,    # Can handle moderate complexity
    'learning_mode': 0.8,      # Want substantial, educational content
    'flow_state': 0.9          # Can tackle complex, challenging content
}

def get_recommendations(cognitive_state, content_database):
    # 1. Filter by cognitive compatibility
    max_complexity = state_complexity_tolerance[cognitive_state]
    suitable_content = content_database[
        content_database['complexity'] <= max_complexity
    ]
    
    # 2. Apply state-specific preferences
    if cognitive_state == 'stress_state':
        # Prefer calming genres, avoid intense content
        suitable_content = prefer_genres(suitable_content, ['comedy', 'animation'])
        suitable_content = avoid_genres(suitable_content, ['thriller', 'horror'])
    
    # 3. Rank by multiple factors
    recommendations = rank_by_multiple_factors(
        suitable_content,
        factors=['complexity_match', 'genre_preference', 'duration_fit']
    )
    
    return recommendations
```

**Key innovation:** Instead of just asking "what do you like?", we ask "what can you mentally handle right now?"

### 5. Real-time Streaming (`realtime_server.py`)

**What it does:** Provides live, real-time cognitive state detection and recommendations via WebSocket.

**Architecture:**

```python
# WebSocket server for real-time updates
class RealTimeMindStateServer:
    async def handle_websocket(self, websocket):
        while True:
            # 1. Generate/receive behavioral event
            behavioral_event = generate_realtime_behavioral_data()
            
            # 2. Predict cognitive state
            if len(behavioral_buffer) >= 5:
                state_prediction = cognitive_classifier.predict(behavioral_buffer)
            
            # 3. Get recommendations
            recommendations = recommender.get_recommendations(
                state_prediction['state']
            )
            
            # 4. Send real-time update to client
            await websocket.send_json({
                'behavioral_metrics': behavioral_event,
                'cognitive_state': state_prediction,
                'recommendations': recommendations
            })
            
            await asyncio.sleep(1.0)  # Update every second
```

**What you see in the dashboard:**
- Live behavioral metrics updating every second
- Real-time cognitive state detection with confidence
- Dynamic recommendations that change as your state changes

## 🎯 The 5 Cognitive States

We detect and optimize for 5 distinct cognitive states:

| State | Behavioral Signature | Content Strategy |
|-------|---------------------|------------------|
| **🔴 Stress** | Fast typing, many errors, frequent app switching | Simple comedies, calming music, short videos |
| **🟡 Recovery** | Slow typing, long pauses, low energy | Familiar shows, light entertainment, comfort content |
| **🟢 Discovery** | Moderate activity, exploratory clicking | Documentaries, new genres, moderate complexity |
| **🔵 Learning** | Deliberate typing, sustained focus, few errors | Educational content, tutorials, substantial material |
| **🟣 Flow** | Fast accurate typing, sustained attention, minimal distractions | Complex films, challenging content, deep material |
